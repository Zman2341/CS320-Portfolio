### CS320 Portfolio Reflection

**How can I make sure my code is functional and secure?**  
I make sure my code works and is secure by testing everything carefully. I used JUnit tests to check that all features (like Contact, Task, and Appointment) followed the rules in the requirements. I tested normal cases and edge cases, like invalid IDs or missing data, to make sure the program handled them properly. This helped me catch mistakes early and know that the program would work in real-world situations.

**How do I understand what users need and include it in my code?**  
I look at what users want the program to do and turn those needs into clear rules for the code. For example, users need to be able to add and update contacts with valid phone numbers and addresses. I used those details when writing and testing my code. Thinking about how real people will use the program helps me design features that make sense and work correctly.

**How do I design software?**  
When I design software, I start with simple ideas and build from there. I plan out the classes and methods first, so everything has one clear job. For this project, I created separate classes for Contacts, Tasks, and Appointments, then wrote service classes to handle adding, updating, and deleting them. I test each part by itself before putting it all together. This helps me keep the code organized, easy to understand, and easy to fix if something goes wrong.
